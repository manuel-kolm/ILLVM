# ILLVM

### <b>A WIP LLVM IR code generator</b>

Simply generate LLVM IR code within C#/.NET, which can be (cross-) compiled to (standalone) machine code for almost every architecture / operating system.

### What can you do with this library?
Generating LLVM IR code for:

- __Your own kernel / operating system within C#?__ Definitly!
- __Creating your own compiler, and maybe also your own language?__ Why not?
- __Creating a transpiler which compiles managed code to machine code?__ Yes, of course.
- __Creating an application which can be compiled to native code?__ Yeah, but it would be a lot easier to use a language which can be directly compiled to machine code.


### Our naming convention sucks?
Yeah, I know, but feel free to share your opinions / suggestions with us.
